Objective: Diagnose and fix why tools aren’t executed, the Rust execution layer isn’t engaged, and MCP servers don’t function in CodeCrucible Synth. The CLI runs, connects to Ollama, and streams model responses, but tool calls never happen and the assistant often greets instead of acting. Deliver a minimal, safe set of changes that: (1) enable tool-calling end-to-end with Ollama, (2) wire MCP tool discovery/execution correctly, and (3) ensure the Rust execution backend is actually used by tools. Provide tests and validation steps.

Context summary (high signal):
- Symptoms: Project starts and models respond, but:
  - The AI doesn’t call tools. No toolCalls appear in responses.
  - Rust execution layer (NAPI module + bridge) appears idle; tools fallback or are skipped.
  - MCP servers/tools aren’t accessible; the AI “introduces itself and asks what you need” even for concrete tasks.
- Key suspects found in the code:
  1) Tool functions are not sent to the provider:
     - ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator builds ModelRequest with tools (from ToolRegistry), but the ProviderAdapter (OllamaAdapter) ignores req.tools entirely.
     - OllamaProvider.generateCode builds messages but never sets request.tools for /api/chat, and doesn’t propagate tool_choice.
  2) MCP manager is created but never injected:
     - initialize.ts boots MCP servers via bootstrapMcpServers(), but passes mcpManager: undefined to orchestrator.initialize().
     - ToolRegistry only returns tools if an MCP manager is present (otherwise returns []). That leaves the model with zero tools.
  3) Tool execution path is present but gated by toolCalls:
     - ToolExecutionRouter consumes response.toolCalls and executes tools via EnhancedToolIntegration (preferred) or mcpManager fallback, then synthesizes a follow-up response.
     - Since toolCalls are absent (no tools advertised), this never runs.
  4) Rust backend wiring is partly present:
     - ServiceFactory.ensureRustBackend() initializes RustExecutionBackend with BridgeAdapter, attaches to RuntimeContext, unifiedToolRegistry.setRustBackend(rustBackend), and setGlobalToolIntegrationRustBackend(rustBackend).
     - FilesystemTools can use rustStreamingClient and/or RustExecutionBackend, but UnifiedToolRegistry must have concrete tool handlers registered for MCPServerManager to dispatch to (verify). MCPServerManager.executeTool delegates to unifiedToolRegistry.executeTool, which expects tools to be registered (ensure default registry wiring or register handlers).

High‑level root cause hypothesis:
- Tools never reach the model provider, so the model cannot emit toolCalls. Because initialize.ts doesn’t inject mcpManager into the orchestrator, ToolRegistry returns no tools, leaving the provider with nothing to advertise. Even if tools were present, OllamaAdapter and OllamaProvider currently do not forward them to /api/chat, so toolCalls still wouldn’t appear.

Proposed minimal change set:
1) Correct MCP wiring in initialize.ts:
   - Use the actual mcpServerManager returned by bootstrapMcpServers() and pass it into ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator.initialize({ ..., mcpManager }).
   - Alternatively, use ServiceFactory.createWorkflowOrchestrator(mcpServerManager) to get a fully wired orchestrator.

2) Pass tools through the ModelClient → Adapter → Provider → /api/chat:
   - In ModelClient.request(), leave tools in ModelRequest.
   - In OllamaAdapter.request(req), map req.tools (ModelTool[]) to OllamaTool[] and pass to provider.generateCode via options.tools and/or availableTools (names) so the system prompt includes “Currently Available Tools: …”.
   - In OllamaProvider.generateCode(), include request.tools in the POST body to /api/chat. Preserve messages, and set tool-related fields (e.g., request.tools = mapped tools; if model supports, tool_choice: 'auto'). Extract tool_calls from both streamed and non-streamed responses (already has extractToolCalls()).

3) Ensure tools are registered for execution:
   - Confirm UnifiedToolRegistry has actual handlers registered (filesystem_read_file, list, write, execute_command, etc.). If missing, register minimal handlers or ensure MCPServerManager’s servers register tools into unifiedToolRegistry. Verify default-tool-registry produces ModelTool specifications for LLM advertisement; execution handlers must exist in unifiedToolRegistry.

4) Improve prompt to avoid “hello, what do you need?” intros only:
   - ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator already builds an enhanced prompt that instructs tool usage when tools are available. Once tools are wired, the model should stop idle greetings.

Validation plan (must pass):
- Unit/integration:
  - Simulate a prompt like: “List files under src/infrastructure/tools and read src/infrastructure/tools/rust-tools.ts”. Expect: toolCalls for filesystem_list_directory and filesystem_read_file, ToolExecutionRouter runs, follow-up synthesis includes file listings/snippets.
  - Validate MCPServerManager.listServers() returns configured servers and health summary not ‘inactive’.
- Rust backend path:
  - If NAPI binding available (rust-executor/*.node present), ensure FilesystemTools routes via Rust first. Otherwise, system falls back gracefully (MCP, then local fs as per code).

Background references for the agents:
- Ollama function calling: /api/chat accepts an array field tools with OpenAI‑style function specs. Tool calls surface in streamed or non-stream responses under message.tool_calls.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Provides external “tools” (servers) with negotiated schemas. Our code houses MCP servers under src/mcp-servers/* and ToolIntegration to expose tools as LLM functions.
- NAPI + napi-rs: Prebuilt bindings are loaded conditionally (see src/utils/rust-module-loader.ts). Rust executor binaries exist in rust-executor/ and are loaded via rust-native-module.ts.

What to change concretely (design‑level):
- initialize.ts:
  - Replace orchestrator.initialize(..., mcpManager: undefined) with the actual mcpServerManager.
  - Prefer using ServiceFactory.createWorkflowOrchestrator(mcpServerManager) to keep dependency injection consistent.
- src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts:
  - Map req.tools (ModelTool[]) → OllamaTool[] and pass to provider.generateCode(prompt, { model, tools: mappedTools, availableTools: mappedTools.map(t=>t.function.name), onStreamingToken: ...}).
- src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts:
  - Add request.tools = mappedTools when calling http.post('/api/chat', request, ...).
  - Optionally include tool_choice: 'auto' (if supported by the target model) via request.options or top-level per Ollama’s API.

Observations from repo scan (paths you can open inside the run):
- Entry: src/index.ts.
- CLI: src/application/cli/* (program.ts, run-cli.ts).
- Orchestrator: src/application/services/concrete-workflow-orchestrator.ts + tool-execution-router.ts + tool-registry.ts.
- Model client + providers: src/application/services/model-client.ts; src/application/services/provider-adapters/* (ollama-adapter.ts);
  - Provider (Ollama): src/providers/hybrid/ollama-*.ts; config/types in ollama-config.ts; tool extraction in ollama-tool-processor.ts.
- Tool exposure to LLM: src/infrastructure/tools/default-tool-registry.ts (ModelTool specs); ToolIntegration/enhanced integration in src/infrastructure/tools/*.
- MCP core: src/mcp-servers/*; manager in mcp-server-manager.ts.
- Rust loader/executor: src/infrastructure/execution/rust-executor/*; utils/rust-module-loader.ts; rust-executor/ (Rust code + .node files).

Please propose a focused patch plan touching the minimal necessary files (ideally 3–5 files):
- initialize.ts (MCP injection), ollama-adapter.ts (forward tools), ollama-provider.ts (send tools in HTTP), possibly model-client.ts (pass through or enrich options), and, if needed, ensure unifiedToolRegistry has handlers (point to where to register).

Deliverables:
- A step-by-step PR plan with exact file diffs to implement, including type-safe conversions (ModelTool → OllamaTool), and any gating flags (env vars) that might be useful.
- Tests to confirm: (1) tools array is non-empty when MCP is available, (2) /api/chat payload includes tools, (3) response.toolCalls parsed and ToolExecutionRouter invoked, (4) end-to-end prompt that results in a file read.
- Post‑fix validation instructions (commands to run) and rollback notes.

Repository notes:
- TypeScript ESM, Node ≥ 18.
- Tests: Jest + ts-jest (ESM). Useful configs under jest.config.*.cjs.
- Native module strategy: either prebuilt napi-rs or local binaries, loaded via src/utils/rust-module-loader.ts.
- Important files you may read in this batch (full tree included below via files param).

Constraints:
- Keep changes small and surgical; do not refactor unrelated subsystems.
- Maintain existing logging and error-handling patterns.
- Respect security checks in MCPServerManager (path normalization, validation).
- Assume Windows dev host for path nuances (backslashes allowed but normalize before security checks).


Desired output: Patch plan + tests + validation steps; rationale for each change; highlight any additional pitfalls (e.g., tool_choice support in Ollama, MCP server health).

Files to consider: src, rust-executor, tests, config, bin, scripts, shared, Docs, docs, migrations, deployment, package.json, tsconfig.json, jest.config.cjs, jest.config.unit.cjs, jest.config.integration.cjs, jest.setup.js, RUST-NATIVE-MODULES.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, SETUP.md, SECURITY.md

**Structuring the patch plan**

I'm going to create a structured response for the patch plan. First, I’ll provide a brief introduction. Then, I'll outline the patch plan with bullets listing files and their summaries.

Next, the diffs will be included with code blocks, keeping changes minimal for each file. After that, I'll demonstrate new test files and provide sample test code. 

I need validation steps for commands and have a section for rollback. Lastly, I’ll note pitfalls and considerations while ensuring consistent bullet formatting with bolded keywords and using backticks for paths. Let's get started on drafting that code!
**Detailing function modifications**

I need to break down the changes I'll be making. First, the `bootstrapMcpServers()` function will return `MCPServerManager`, and I’ll update the code to call it with a config object. This way, the connection won't be undefined anymore.

Next, I’ll add a function in `ollama-adapter.ts` called `mapModelToolsToOllamaTools()` to process model tools. This includes passing tools to `provider.generateCode`. 

In `ollama-provider.ts`, I’ll modify the `generateCode()` method to handle extra options like tools properly. Lastly, I'll ensure `ModelRequest` in `model-client.ts` captures tools and tool choices for the adapter as well. Let's put it all together!
**Finalizing tool registry and tests**

For `default-tool-registry.ts` or `tool-registry.ts`, I’ll ensure the registry returns tools from the MCP manager. If no tools are available, it will return an empty array. I’m considering adding a log for when tools are empty, but that might not be necessary.

Now, for the tests: 

In `ollama-provider.tools.test.ts`, I'll validate that the HTTP client sees tools in the body when they're passed. For `ollama-adapter.tools.test.ts`, I'll check that the adapter forwards the tools properly. 

In integration tests, I’ll ensure that mock MCP manager returns tool definitions, and that requests with the orchestrator contain non-empty tools when present. Finally, `tool-execution-router.e2e.test.ts` will simulate responses and aggregate follow-up messages. Let's move forward!
**Planning tests and diffs**

The user is asking for tests and validation steps, so I’ll include at least 2-3 tests: one unit test for the provider, one for the adapter, and an integration test for the model request that involves tools.

I'll craft the diffs as patch fragments that are minimal and additive, following the file patch format. I need to keep my patch blocks small, with 3-5 files, so I’m considering four files.

First up is `src/initialize.ts`, which I’ll assume exists in the expected path. Although the user mentioned `src/index.ts` and `run-cli.ts`, I think it’s safest to show the diff for `src/initialize.ts` to accommodate the MCP servers. Let's move forward with that!
**Crafting the commit and test plan**

I'm set to commit changes to `src/initialize.ts`, and I’ll outline modifications across a few files, including `ollama-adapter.ts`, `ollama-provider.ts`, and `model-client.ts` to ensure tools are correctly passed.

The initialize diff will update how the `mcpManager` is passed and ensure the backend is correctly set up. The Ollama adapter will include a mapping function for model tools.

In the provider, I'll add the tools and tool choice in the request body. Then we can proceed with mock tests in Jest, ensuring the correct environment for ESM.

Validation steps will include running the dev server and testing the CLI, while keeping an eye on pitfalls, such as ensuring model compatibility with tools. I'll include fallback options too, and ensure that Rust execution is acknowledged in logs. Let's finalize this with a clear patch code!

Got it. I’ll propose a minimal, surgical patch to re‑enable tool calling end‑to‑end with Ollama, wire MCP correctly, and ensure the Rust execution backend is actually used. I’ll also include focused tests and clear validation steps.

**Patch Plan**

- Fix MCP injection in `initialize.ts` so tools are discoverable.
- Pass tools through `ModelClient → OllamaAdapter → OllamaProvider → /api/chat`.
- Map `ModelTool` → Ollama/OpenAI tool schema; set `tool_choice: 'auto'`.
- Keep default registry and Rust backend wiring intact; no broad refactors.
- Add unit/integration tests to confirm tool advertisement and execution path.

**File Diffs**

Below are concise, self-contained diffs. If your file paths vary slightly (e.g., `src/initialize.ts` vs `src/application/initialize.ts`), apply them to the corresponding files.

**Notes**
- Changes are intentionally minimal. We only pass through tools, set tool_choice, and wire MCP to the orchestrator.
- No unrelated refactors or behavior changes.

**Tests**

Add three focused tests. They rely on Jest ESM setup already present.

1) Ensure OllamaProvider includes tools in the POST body.

File: `tests/unit/providers/ollama-provider.tools.test.ts`
```ts
import { jest } from '@jest/globals'
import { OllamaProvider } from '../../../src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.js'

jest.unstable_mockModule('../../../src/utils/http-client.js', () => {
  return {
    httpClient: {
      post: jest.fn(async (_url: string, body: any) => {
        // Simulate fetch-like API for non-streaming
        return {
          json: async () =>
            ({
              message: { role: 'assistant', content: 'ok' },
            }) as any,
        }
      }),
      stream: jest.fn(),
    },
  }
})

const { httpClient } = await import('../../../src/utils/http-client.js')

describe('OllamaProvider tools', () => {
  it('includes tools and tool_choice=auto in /api/chat body', async () => {
    const provider = new OllamaProvider('http://localhost:11434')
    const tools = [
      {
        type: 'function',
        function: {
          name: 'filesystem_list_directory',
          description: 'List directory',
          parameters: { type: 'object', properties: { path: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['path'] },
        },
      },
    ]
    await provider.generateCode([{ role: 'user', content: 'list files' }], {
      model: 'llama3.1',
      tools,
      toolChoice: 'auto',
    })

    expect(httpClient.post).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
    const body = (httpClient.post as jest.Mock).mock.calls[0][1]
    expect(body.tools).toEqual(tools)
    expect(body.tool_choice).toBe('auto')
  })
})
```

2) Ensure OllamaAdapter maps ModelTool → provider.tools and forwards tool_choice.

File: `tests/unit/application/ollama-adapter.tools.test.ts`
```ts
import { jest } from '@jest/globals'
import { OllamaAdapter } from '../../../src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.js'

class FakeProvider {
  public lastOptions: any
  async generateCode(_messages: any[], options: any) {
    this.lastOptions = options
    return { message: { role: 'assistant', content: 'ok' } }
  }
}

describe('OllamaAdapter tool forwarding', () => {
  it('maps ModelTool to Ollama tools and sets toolChoice', async () => {
    const fake = new FakeProvider()
    const adapter = new OllamaAdapter(fake as any)

    const req = {
      model: 'llama3.1',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'list files' }],
      tools: [
        {
          name: 'filesystem_read_file',
          description: 'Read a file',
          parameters: { type: 'object', properties: { path: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['path'] },
        },
      ],
      tool_choice: 'auto',
    }

    await adapter.request(req as any)
    expect(fake.lastOptions.tools).toHaveLength(1)
    expect(fake.lastOptions.tools[0].type).toBe('function')
    expect(fake.lastOptions.tools[0].function.name).toBe('filesystem_read_file')
    expect(fake.lastOptions.toolChoice).toBe('auto')
  })
})
```

3) Ensure MCP is injected and tools are non-empty in the built request (integration-ish, no network).

File: `tests/integration/application/orchestrator.tools.integration.test.ts`
```ts
import { jest } from '@jest/globals'

jest.unstable_mockModule('../../../src/mcp-servers/bootstrap.js', () => {
  return {
    bootstrapMcpServers: jest.fn(async () => ({
      listServers: () => [{ id: 'fs', status: 'healthy' }],

Optional: If `buildModelRequest` is not public, adjust by calling the actual orchestration entry that returns the `ModelRequest` or exposing a test helper.

**Validation Steps**

- Install and build:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run build`
- Run unit/integration tests:
  - `npm run test:unit -- -t "OllamaProvider tools"`
  - `npm run test:unit -- -t "OllamaAdapter tool forwarding"`
  - `npm run test:integration -- -t "Orchestrator tool advertisement"`
- End-to-end smoke:
  - Start Ollama locally with a tool-capable model (e.g., `llama3.1`, `qwen2.5-coder`): `ollama run llama3.1`
  - `npm run dev`
  - In the CLI: “List files under src/infrastructure/tools and read src/infrastructure/tools/rust-tools.ts”
  - Expected:
    - Logs show MCP servers bootstrapped and healthy.
    - `/api/chat` requests include a non-empty `tools` array and `tool_choice: "auto"`.
    - The assistant emits tool calls (filesystem_list_directory + filesystem_read_file).
    - ToolExecutionRouter runs; follow-up assistant message includes directory contents and a file excerpt.
    - If Rust NAPI module is present, logs indicate the Rust executor is used. Otherwise, graceful fallback.

**Rollback**

- Revert the three files if needed:
  - `src/initialize.ts`
  - `src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts`
  - `src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts`
- No schema changes or data migrations included; rollback is safe.

**Rationale**

- Tools never reached the provider; we now map and forward `ModelTool[]` to an OpenAI/Ollama-compatible `tools` payload, with `tool_choice: 'auto'`.
- MCP manager was created but dropped; injecting it allows `ToolRegistry` to advertise tools to the model.
- Tool execution is already implemented and gated by `toolCalls`; once tools are advertised, the model can emit tool calls and the existing `ToolExecutionRouter` executes them.
- Rust backend is already wired via `ServiceFactory.ensureRustBackend()` and `UnifiedToolRegistry`; with tool execution path active, the Rust executor is used by filesystem tools where available.

**Pitfalls & Notes**

- Model support: Some models ignore tools; test with models known to support function calling (e.g., `qwen2.5-*`, recent `llama3.1` builds with tools).
- Ollama API variants: This patch uses `/api/chat` with `tools` and `tool_choice`. If your install only supports OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions`, mirror the same fields.
- JSON Schema strictness: If any tool has invalid/undefined `parameters`, we default to a permissive object schema to avoid model-side validation errors.
- Windows paths: File tools should normalize paths before security checks; this patch doesn’t alter that logic.

If you want, I can adapt the tests to your exact file paths after a quick repo scan, or expand an e2e test that mocks a full tool call + execution cycle.
