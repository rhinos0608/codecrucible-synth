--------
[2025-09-08T04:28:52] User instructions:
Context: Repo: codecrucible-synth (TypeScript, ESM)
Highlights:
- src/index.ts is now a minimal entry delegating CLI wiring.
- EventBus factory: src/infrastructure/messaging/event-bus-factory.ts
- Plugin path resolver: src/infrastructure/plugins/plugin-path-resolver.ts
- Observability coordinator exposes MetricsCollector; bridge health metrics emitted periodically.
- Keep ESM import style with .js extensions at compile time.

Key files (examples; agents can inspect more):
- src/domain/services/unified-performance-system.ts (big, good candidate)
- src/infrastructure/execution/request-execution-manager.ts (big)
- src/infrastructure/security/enterprise-auth-manager.ts (big)


Agent: Refactor very large TypeScript modules (>1000 LOC) into smaller, cohesive modules while retaining behavior and import paths. Target candidates include:
- src/infrastructure/enterprise-deployment-system.ts (~1566 lines)
- src/domain/services/unified-agent/legacy-unified-agent-system.ts (~1470)
- src/domain/types/unified-types.ts (~1279)
- src/infrastructure/backup/backup-manager.ts (~1183)
- src/infrastructure/cache/unified-cache-system.ts (~1182)
- src/domain/services/unified-security-validator.ts (~1147)
- src/infrastructure/performance/unified-resource-coordinator.ts (~1113)
- src/domain/services/unified-server-system.ts (~1101)
- src/domain/services/unified-performance-system.ts (~1094)
- src/infrastructure/security/enterprise-auth-manager.ts (~1073)
- src/infrastructure/security/production-rbac-system.ts (~1069)
- src/adapters/file-operations-adapter.ts (~1013)
- src/application/services/performance/predictive-analytics.ts (~1009)
- src/infrastructure/execution/request-execution-manager.ts (~1003)

Constraints & goals:
- Preserve public API/exports and imports; keep relative .js extensions for ESM.
- Extract cohesive submodules (e.g., types, helpers, strategies, adapters) into colocated files under the same directory.
- Replace giant switch/if chains with strategy registries when appropriate.
- Add minimal barrel files (index.ts) where it reduces import churn.
- No behavior changes; ensure unit/integration tests still pass.
- Update internal imports in the refactored files; do not change external call sites unless using barrel re-exports.
- Run typecheck and tests locally; fix any circular imports introduced.
- Keep changes incremental per module: commit sized chunks per module with clear messages.

Context notes:
- ESM project with .js extensions in TS imports; Node >= 18.
- Event bus and observability exist; avoid changing them.
- ServiceFactory and CLI bootstrap are already modular; do not expand.
- Large files often bundle: types + validation + orchestration + I/O; target clean splits.

Suggested refactor patterns per file:
- *unified-performance-system.ts*: split interfaces/types, monitor, analyzer, optimizer, and facade into separate files; keep facade export same.
- *unified-server-system.ts*: separate configuration/types, HTTP server, WebSocket server, MCP wiring.
- *enterprise-auth-manager.ts/production-rbac-system.ts*: extract policies, evaluators, utilities.
- *request-execution-manager.ts*: separate request parsing, execution strategies, and error handling.

Validation commands to run:
- npm run typecheck
- npm run test:fast (then npm test if fast passes)

Deliverables:
- Refactored modules with clean internal structure.
- Passing typecheck and tests.
- A short SUMMARY.md per module changed describing what was moved where.


Desired output: Refactored modules + passing typecheck/tests + per-module SUMMARY.md

**Considering code refactoring constraints**

We need to refactor code in a repo, but the environment settings indicate it's read-only with restricted network access. This means I can't run shell commands that modify files. The guidelines mention using apply_patch to edit files, but being in read-only mode likely blocks that too. So, I can't perform the refactor now. I’ll have to plan around this limitation, perhaps by preparing a patch or instructions for later use while checking what tools are available to read files.
**Analyzing PowerShell constraints**

The environment operates with PowerShell, but our functions.shell is more generic. It looks like we can use tools like rg and fd on Windows, and it’s likely that ripgrep is installed here. I want to list the files to find large ones for refactoring, but since the sandbox is read-only, I can't use the apply_patch tool. I can't request approval either, so I’ll need to propose changes in the output or create a patch file for users to apply later.
**Planning for file refactoring**

I need to read the large files to grasp their structure and create a refactor plan, including code skeletons and summaries. I can provide file diffs for manual application. The guidelines allow markdown for the final output, so I can detail a per-module plan, which includes file movements and updated internal imports. Since we can't execute changes directly, I should clearly explain our limitations and present a step-by-step patch sample. 

I’ll run ripgrep to list the large files and might use PowerShell to check file sizes. Let's get those target paths!

I’m going to scan the repo to locate the large target modules and inspect a few to plan precise refactors and produce patch-ready changes.

**Planning module refactor**

I’m thinking we should outline a thorough plan and patch sequences for a single module as a starting point. To keep things manageable, I'll focus on 1–2 modules, specifically proposing an incremental refactor for the module at src/domain/services/unified-performance-system.ts. 

I'll create a new folder and several files within it, including types.ts, monitor.ts, and more. The original file will need to re-export from a facade to maintain compatibility while keeping existing import paths intact, avoiding circular dependencies. This sounds like a solid approach!
**Crafting patch content**

Considering the limitations, I believe the best deliverable would be a detailed patch for one module that users can readily apply. I’d suggest using the apply_patch tool to include a unified diff block. 

We need to summarize content per module, selecting one for complete refactoring while outlining patterns for others. Since the user requested refactoring and passing tests, it's essential to clarify our constraints. I'll structure the split for unified-performance-system.ts around common patterns like types and helpers without altering behavior, ensuring we proceed carefully to avoid breaking anything.
**Requesting user input**

I'm facing a challenge here because I can't determine what's pure without reading the code, making it unsafe to split files. An alternative could be to provide a method along with an automated refactor script that parses TypeScript and splits it based on comment markers, but I don't know those markers.

Given these constraints, it seems best to ask the user for permission to enable writing or run read commands to inspect files. I should request specific file snippets or ask them to lift the sandbox for validation.
**Requesting permissions**

I need to keep things concise here: the current environment doesn't allow file edits or even read commands. So, I should ask the user to either grant us workspace-write access or provide the contents of one target module. This will help us perform a surgical split with a patch.

I propose starting with unified-performance-system.ts first, outlining the steps and naming structure, and then moving on to request-execution-manager.ts. I'll also create a summary template for SUMMARY.md and offer to generate a patch diff once I can read the file.

[2025-09-08T04:29:23] codex

I’m blocked by the sandbox: file writes are disabled, and even safe read commands (git/rg) are auto-rejected. I can’t inspect or refactor files in-place.

Two options to proceed:
- Grant workspace-write (and allow read commands) so I can inspect and apply patches; or
- Paste the contents of one target file (e.g., src/domain/services/unified-performance-system.ts), and I’ll produce a precise apply_patch diff that preserves the public API and .js ESM imports.

If you enable writes, I’ll:
- Split unified-performance-system.ts into colocated modules: types.js, validators.js, monitor.js, analyzer.js, optimizer.js, facade.js, index.ts (barrel).
- Keep the original import path working by re-exporting the facade from the original path.
- Run npm run typecheck and npm run test:fast, fix any circulars, and add SUMMARY.md describing moves.
- Then apply the same pattern to request-execution-manager.ts.

Which path do you prefer?
