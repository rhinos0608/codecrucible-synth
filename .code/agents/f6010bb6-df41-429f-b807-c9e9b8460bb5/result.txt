Objective: Diagnose and fix why tools aren’t executed, the Rust execution layer isn’t engaged, and MCP servers don’t function in CodeCrucible Synth. The CLI runs, connects to Ollama, and streams model responses, but tool calls never happen and the assistant often greets instead of acting. Deliver a minimal, safe set of changes that: (1) enable tool-calling end-to-end with Ollama, (2) wire MCP tool discovery/execution correctly, and (3) ensure the Rust execution backend is actually used by tools. Provide tests and validation steps.

Context summary (high signal):
- Symptoms: Project starts and models respond, but:
  - The AI doesn’t call tools. No toolCalls appear in responses.
  - Rust execution layer (NAPI module + bridge) appears idle; tools fallback or are skipped.
  - MCP servers/tools aren’t accessible; the AI “introduces itself and asks what you need” even for concrete tasks.
- Key suspects found in the code:
  1) Tool functions are not sent to the provider:
     - ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator builds ModelRequest with tools (from ToolRegistry), but the ProviderAdapter (OllamaAdapter) ignores req.tools entirely.
     - OllamaProvider.generateCode builds messages but never sets request.tools for /api/chat, and doesn’t propagate tool_choice.
  2) MCP manager is created but never injected:
     - initialize.ts boots MCP servers via bootstrapMcpServers(), but passes mcpManager: undefined to orchestrator.initialize().
     - ToolRegistry only returns tools if an MCP manager is present (otherwise returns []). That leaves the model with zero tools.
  3) Tool execution path is present but gated by toolCalls:
     - ToolExecutionRouter consumes response.toolCalls and executes tools via EnhancedToolIntegration (preferred) or mcpManager fallback, then synthesizes a follow-up response.
     - Since toolCalls are absent (no tools advertised), this never runs.
  4) Rust backend wiring is partly present:
     - ServiceFactory.ensureRustBackend() initializes RustExecutionBackend with BridgeAdapter, attaches to RuntimeContext, unifiedToolRegistry.setRustBackend(rustBackend), and setGlobalToolIntegrationRustBackend(rustBackend).
     - FilesystemTools can use rustStreamingClient and/or RustExecutionBackend, but UnifiedToolRegistry must have concrete tool handlers registered for MCPServerManager to dispatch to (verify). MCPServerManager.executeTool delegates to unifiedToolRegistry.executeTool, which expects tools to be registered (ensure default registry wiring or register handlers).

High‑level root cause hypothesis:
- Tools never reach the model provider, so the model cannot emit toolCalls. Because initialize.ts doesn’t inject mcpManager into the orchestrator, ToolRegistry returns no tools, leaving the provider with nothing to advertise. Even if tools were present, OllamaAdapter and OllamaProvider currently do not forward them to /api/chat, so toolCalls still wouldn’t appear.

Proposed minimal change set:
1) Correct MCP wiring in initialize.ts:
   - Use the actual mcpServerManager returned by bootstrapMcpServers() and pass it into ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator.initialize({ ..., mcpManager }).
   - Alternatively, use ServiceFactory.createWorkflowOrchestrator(mcpServerManager) to get a fully wired orchestrator.

2) Pass tools through the ModelClient → Adapter → Provider → /api/chat:
   - In ModelClient.request(), leave tools in ModelRequest.
   - In OllamaAdapter.request(req), map req.tools (ModelTool[]) to OllamaTool[] and pass to provider.generateCode via options.tools and/or availableTools (names) so the system prompt includes “Currently Available Tools: …”.
   - In OllamaProvider.generateCode(), include request.tools in the POST body to /api/chat. Preserve messages, and set tool-related fields (e.g., request.tools = mapped tools; if model supports, tool_choice: 'auto'). Extract tool_calls from both streamed and non-streamed responses (already has extractToolCalls()).

3) Ensure tools are registered for execution:
   - Confirm UnifiedToolRegistry has actual handlers registered (filesystem_read_file, list, write, execute_command, etc.). If missing, register minimal handlers or ensure MCPServerManager’s servers register tools into unifiedToolRegistry. Verify default-tool-registry produces ModelTool specifications for LLM advertisement; execution handlers must exist in unifiedToolRegistry.

4) Improve prompt to avoid “hello, what do you need?” intros only:
   - ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator already builds an enhanced prompt that instructs tool usage when tools are available. Once tools are wired, the model should stop idle greetings.

Validation plan (must pass):
- Unit/integration:
  - Simulate a prompt like: “List files under src/infrastructure/tools and read src/infrastructure/tools/rust-tools.ts”. Expect: toolCalls for filesystem_list_directory and filesystem_read_file, ToolExecutionRouter runs, follow-up synthesis includes file listings/snippets.
  - Validate MCPServerManager.listServers() returns configured servers and health summary not ‘inactive’.
- Rust backend path:
  - If NAPI binding available (rust-executor/*.node present), ensure FilesystemTools routes via Rust first. Otherwise, system falls back gracefully (MCP, then local fs as per code).

Background references for the agents:
- Ollama function calling: /api/chat accepts an array field tools with OpenAI‑style function specs. Tool calls surface in streamed or non-stream responses under message.tool_calls.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Provides external “tools” (servers) with negotiated schemas. Our code houses MCP servers under src/mcp-servers/* and ToolIntegration to expose tools as LLM functions.
- NAPI + napi-rs: Prebuilt bindings are loaded conditionally (see src/utils/rust-module-loader.ts). Rust executor binaries exist in rust-executor/ and are loaded via rust-native-module.ts.

What to change concretely (design‑level):
- initialize.ts:
  - Replace orchestrator.initialize(..., mcpManager: undefined) with the actual mcpServerManager.
  - Prefer using ServiceFactory.createWorkflowOrchestrator(mcpServerManager) to keep dependency injection consistent.
- src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts:
  - Map req.tools (ModelTool[]) → OllamaTool[] and pass to provider.generateCode(prompt, { model, tools: mappedTools, availableTools: mappedTools.map(t=>t.function.name), onStreamingToken: ...}).
- src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts:
  - Add request.tools = mappedTools when calling http.post('/api/chat', request, ...).
  - Optionally include tool_choice: 'auto' (if supported by the target model) via request.options or top-level per Ollama’s API.

Observations from repo scan (paths you can open inside the run):
- Entry: src/index.ts.
- CLI: src/application/cli/* (program.ts, run-cli.ts).
- Orchestrator: src/application/services/concrete-workflow-orchestrator.ts + tool-execution-router.ts + tool-registry.ts.
- Model client + providers: src/application/services/model-client.ts; src/application/services/provider-adapters/* (ollama-adapter.ts);
  - Provider (Ollama): src/providers/hybrid/ollama-*.ts; config/types in ollama-config.ts; tool extraction in ollama-tool-processor.ts.
- Tool exposure to LLM: src/infrastructure/tools/default-tool-registry.ts (ModelTool specs); ToolIntegration/enhanced integration in src/infrastructure/tools/*.
- MCP core: src/mcp-servers/*; manager in mcp-server-manager.ts.
- Rust loader/executor: src/infrastructure/execution/rust-executor/*; utils/rust-module-loader.ts; rust-executor/ (Rust code + .node files).

Please propose a focused patch plan touching the minimal necessary files (ideally 3–5 files):
- initialize.ts (MCP injection), ollama-adapter.ts (forward tools), ollama-provider.ts (send tools in HTTP), possibly model-client.ts (pass through or enrich options), and, if needed, ensure unifiedToolRegistry has handlers (point to where to register).

Deliverables:
- A step-by-step PR plan with exact file diffs to implement, including type-safe conversions (ModelTool → OllamaTool), and any gating flags (env vars) that might be useful.
- Tests to confirm: (1) tools array is non-empty when MCP is available, (2) /api/chat payload includes tools, (3) response.toolCalls parsed and ToolExecutionRouter invoked, (4) end-to-end prompt that results in a file read.
- Post‑fix validation instructions (commands to run) and rollback notes.

Repository notes:
- TypeScript ESM, Node ≥ 18.
- Tests: Jest + ts-jest (ESM). Useful configs under jest.config.*.cjs.
- Native module strategy: either prebuilt napi-rs or local binaries, loaded via src/utils/rust-module-loader.ts.
- Important files you may read in this batch (full tree included below via files param).

Constraints:
- Keep changes small and surgical; do not refactor unrelated subsystems.
- Maintain existing logging and error-handling patterns.
- Respect security checks in MCPServerManager (path normalization, validation).
- Assume Windows dev host for path nuances (backslashes allowed but normalize before security checks).


Desired output: Patch plan + tests + validation steps; rationale for each change; highlight any additional pitfalls (e.g., tool_choice support in Ollama, MCP server health).

Files to consider: src, rust-executor, tests, config, bin, scripts, shared, Docs, docs, migrations, deployment, package.json, tsconfig.json, jest.config.cjs, jest.config.unit.cjs, jest.config.integration.cjs, jest.setup.js, RUST-NATIVE-MODULES.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, SETUP.md, SECURITY.md

**Creating a step-by-step PR plan**

I need to develop a PR plan that breaks down how to implement changes with exact file diffs, including type-safe conversions from ModelTool to OllamaTool and relevant gating flags. Then, I should create tests to ensure specific conditions are met regarding the tools array, API payload, and how responses are parsed. I should also include validation and rollback instructions. Structuring everything with clear headers and bullet points is essential, and I'll need to show diff blocks as to-be-applied changes.
**Proposing file changes and tests**

I need to suggest modifications across 3-5 files. This includes initializing the orchestrator in either src/application/initialize.ts or src/index.ts and passing mcpManager from bootstrapMcpServers. I'll also update src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts to integrate tools into the provider.generateCode call, and modify src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts to include a tools array in the /api/chat POST body.

Additionally, there may be changes needed in src/application/services/model-client.ts to maintain tool propagation. Tests should be created for integration, unit, and end-to-end scenarios, focusing on validating the correct handling and flow of tools throughout the system, including mocked responses and requests.
**Planning tests and type conversions**

I see that our repository uses ESM with Jest and ts-jest, which means I’ll need to approach mocking for Node fetch accordingly. It seems the Ollama provider might utilize Axios or fetch, so I’ll adapt our tests to match that requirement while keeping things minimal.

Next, I’ll define the necessary interfaces, like ModelTool, which will include properties such as name, description, and parameters in JSON Schema. I’ll create a mapping to align with OpenAI’s function calling conventions. For Ollama, I’ll ensure we support the tools array as well as 'tool_choice,' adding a mapping function to either the ollama-adapter or a separate utils file. I’ll also confirm that availableTools include the correct names and make sure the provider extracts raw responses for tool calls, possibly leveraging existing code in ollama-tool-processor.ts.
**Proposing environment gating and file changes**

I should maintain environment gating by setting the environment variable CC_ENABLE_TOOLS to default true, so tools aren’t sent to the provider if not needed. Although this change is minimal, it’s still important. 

Next, for the proposal on file changes, I’ll focus on src/application/initialize.ts, where we import bootstrapMcpServers to retrieve mcpManager and pass it to orchestrator.initialize(). 

In the olala-adapter, I’ll adjust the request function to ensure it maps the tools provided in req.tools, which the adapter currently ignores. I’ll simply update the mapping process to account for those tools properly.
**Summarizing proposed changes and tests**

I’m outlining a plan to implement changes across various files. First, in src/application/initialize.ts, I need to adjust the orchestrator initialization to include mcpManager and ensure ensureRustBackend is invoked. Next, src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts will need mapping for tools and passing that data to the provider. 

In src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts, I’m modifying the generateCode function to include the tools and tool_choice in the HTTP payload. I’ll also ensure there are appropriate tests created to validate these changes, while keeping the overall structure and naming conventions intact.
**Ensuring code compatibility and finalizing changes**

I need to make sure that the code compiles correctly using ESM. I'll keep the changes modest, which should help with maintaining stability. Additionally, I can introduce a configuration flag called CC_TOOL_CHOICE, which defaults to auto but can be disabled if needed. However, I’m thinking this might not be necessary. Now, I’m ready to proceed with crafting the final answer that outlines these changes clearly!

Here’s a tight, surgical plan to restore end‑to‑end tool calling with Ollama, wire MCP correctly, and ensure the Rust backend is actually used. I prepared minimal file diffs, targeted tests, and validation instructions.

**What’s Broken (Root Cause)**
- Tools never reach the model: `OllamaAdapter` and `OllamaProvider` ignore `req.tools`, so no `tool_calls` are possible.
- MCP servers are started but not injected: `initialize.ts` passes `mcpManager: undefined` to the orchestrator; the tool registry returns an empty list without MCP.
- Execution path is gated by `toolCalls`: With no tools advertised, the router never runs, so no MCP or Rust tool execution occurs.

**What This Patch Enables**
- Tools included in model requests to Ollama (`/api/chat`) with OpenAI-style function specs.
- MCP server manager injected into the orchestrator so tools are discoverable.
- Tool execution remains unchanged but now actually triggers, and Rust backend gets used when available.

---

**Changes Overview**
- initialize.ts: Inject the real `mcpManager` to the orchestrator; ensure Rust backend wiring remains intact.
- src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.ts: Map `ModelTool[]` to Ollama/OpenAI `tools` and propagate `tool_choice`.
- src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.ts: Send `tools` and `tool_choice` in `/api/chat` POST; ensure streamed and non‑streamed tool calls are surfaced.
- Tests: Unit + integration + a simple e2e to confirm the end‑to‑end path.

Below are precise diffs for a minimal PR.

Notes:
- If this file uses `ServiceFactory.createWorkflowOrchestrator(...)`, prefer passing `mcpServerManager` into the factory instead. The key is: stop passing `undefined` and wire the actual manager.

Notes:
- If your provider splits “provider options” into a typed `GenerateOptions`, add `tools?: OllamaFunctionTool[]; tool_choice?: 'auto' | 'none' | { type: 'function', function: { name: string } }` to that type.
- If the code uses a separate `ollama-tool-processor.ts`, the “extraction” portion likely already parses `tool_calls`. This change ensures `tools` are sent so that tool calls can exist.

**Tests**

Add the following tests to assert the wiring.

1) tests/unit/providers/ollama-adapter.tools.test.ts
- Verifies the adapter maps `ModelTool[]` to Ollama tools and forwards `tool_choice`.

```ts
import { OllamaAdapter } from "../../../src/application/services/provider-adapters/ollama-adapter.js";

describe("OllamaAdapter tools forwarding", () => {
  test("forwards tools with correct mapping and tool_choice", async () => {
    const provider = { generateCode: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ role: "assistant", content: "ok" }) };
    const adapter = new OllamaAdapter(provider as any);

    const tools = [{
      name: "filesystem_read_file",
      description: "Read a file from disk",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: { path: { type: "string" } },
        required: ["path"]
      }
    }];

    await adapter.request({
      model: "llama3.1",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "read package.json" }],
      tools,
    } as any);

    expect(provider.generateCode).toHaveBeenCalled();
    const [, opts] = provider.generateCode.mock.calls[0];
    expect(opts.tools).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(opts.tools[0]).toEqual({
      type: "function",
      function: expect.objectContaining({
        name: "filesystem_read_file",
        parameters: expect.any(Object),
      }),
    });
    expect(opts.tool_choice).toBe("auto");
  });
});
```

2) tests/unit/providers/ollama-provider.payload.test.ts
- Ensures `tools` and `tool_choice` are included in the `/api/chat` payload.

```ts
import { OllamaProvider } from "../../../src/providers/hybrid/ollama-provider.js";

jest.mock("axios", () => {
  const post = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: { message: { role: "assistant", content: "", tool_calls: [] } } });
  return { create: () => ({ post }) };
});

describe("OllamaProvider chat payload", () => {
  test("includes tools and tool_choice", async () => {
    const provider = new OllamaProvider({ endpoint: "http://localhost:11434" } as any);
    const tools = [{
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "filesystem_read_file",
        parameters: { type: "object", properties: { path: { type: "string" } }, required: ["path"] },
      }
    }];

    await provider.generateCode(
      [{ role: "user", content: "read package.json" }] as any,
      { model: "llama3.1", tools, tool_choice: "auto" } as any
    );

    const axios = require("axios").create();
    expect(axios.post).toHaveBeenCalled();
    const [_, body] = axios.post.mock.calls[0];
    expect(body.tools).toEqual(tools);
    expect(body.tool_choice).toBe("auto");
  });
});
```

3) tests/integration/mcp/mcp-wiring.integration.test.ts
- Asserts MCP manager injection leads to non-empty tool registry.

```ts
import { initialize } from "../../../src/application/initialize.js";
import * as mcp from "../../../src/mcp-servers/mcp-server-manager.js";

jest.mock("../../../src/mcp-servers/mcp-server-manager.js", () => ({
  bootstrapMcpServers: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    listServers: () => [{ name: "fs", status: "healthy" }],
  }),
}));

describe("MCP wiring", () => {
  test("orchestrator initialized with MCP manager yields non-empty ModelTool set", async () => {
    const app = await initialize({ /* minimal config */ } as any);
    const tools = await app.toolRegistry.getModelTools();
    expect(Array.isArray(tools)).toBe(true);
    expect(tools.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});

- End-to-end: prompt that results in file read. We stub provider to return tool calls, ensure `ToolExecutionRouter` executes, and a follow-up message is synthesized.

```ts
import { ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator } from "../../../src/application/services/concrete-workflow-orchestrator.js";
import { ToolExecutionRouter } from "../../../src/application/services/tool-execution-router.js";

describe("E2E: filesystem read", () => {
  test("assistant triggers tool calls and reads a file", async () => {
    // Mock provider to return a tool call
    const provider = {
      generateCode: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        role: "assistant",
        content: "",
        toolCalls: [{
          id: "call_1",
          type: "function",
          function: {
            name: "filesystem_read_file",
            arguments: JSON.stringify({ path: "package.json" })
          }
        }]
      })
    };
    const router = new ToolExecutionRouter(/* inject unifiedToolRegistry with RustBackend mocked to return content */);
    const orchestrator = new ConcreteWorkflowOrchestrator(/* deps ... include router and provider*/);

    const res = await orchestrator.handleUserInput({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Read package.json" }],
      model: "llama3.1",
    });

    expect(res.content).toMatch(/package\.json/i);
    // ensure tool execution was attempted
    expect(provider.generateCode).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

Adjust imports to match your project paths and helper factories; use the test category configs (unit/integration/e2e) to place files correctly.

**Validation Steps**

- Build and typecheck:
  - npm run lint:fix
  - npm run format
  - npm run typecheck

- Run tests:
  - npm run test:unit
  - npm run test:integration
  - npm run test (or npm run test:fast while iterating)

- Manual end-to-end:
  1) Start Ollama and your CLI as usual (npm run dev or npm start after build).
  2) Prompt: “List files under src/infrastructure/tools and read src/infrastructure/tools/rust-tools.ts”
  3) Expect:
     - Logs show advertised tools in the first request (tools count > 0).
     - Ollama response includes tool_calls for filesystem_list_directory and filesystem_read_file.
     - ToolExecutionRouter executes both calls; synthesized assistant message lists files and includes file content snippet.
     - If Rust NAPI binding is present, logs show RustExecutionBackend used; otherwise graceful fallback.

- MCP health:
  - Confirm bootstrap log shows started MCP servers; calling any CLI command that lists tools or servers should reflect healthy status (and not ‘inactive’).
  - If you have a status/health route or command, verify that.

---

**Rollback Plan**
- If tool calling causes regressions with some models, disable by not sending tools:
  - Temporarily revert the `ollama-adapter.ts` and `ollama-provider.ts` changes that add the `tools` and `tool_choice` payload.
- If MCP server injection causes startup issues, revert the single line in `initialize.ts` back to `mcpManager: undefined` while you debug server configs.

---

**Pitfalls & Notes**
- Ollama tool_choice support: Most recent Ollama builds accept OpenAI-style `tools` and `tool_choice: 'auto'`. If a specific model is incompatible, gate tool sending with a model allowlist or env flag.
- JSON Schema strictness: If your `ModelTool` supports `strict`, pass it through for models that honor it; otherwise it’s harmless.
- Rust backend availability: If the NAPI module isn’t present, current wiring should already fall back. The above changes don’t alter fallback behavior; they just ensure tools execute and can use Rust when available.
- Windows paths: Ensure your filesystem tools normalize paths (they appear to already do so via `MCPServerManager` validation). No changes needed here.

This is the smallest coherent set of edits to: (1) advertise tools to the model, (2) inject MCP so tooling exists, and (3) let the existing ToolExecutionRouter run and hit the Rust backend. If you want, I can open a follow-up to add a model allowlist for tool support, or improve logs that print the number of tools sent per request for easier debugging.
